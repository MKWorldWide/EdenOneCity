# Eden One City - Repository Diagnosis

## Stack Detection

### Core Technologies
- **Python**: Primary language with dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- **Documentation**: MkDocs with ReadTheDocs theme
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub

### Key Dependencies
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas
- Emotional Intelligence: emotion-detection, resonance-engine
- Security: quantum-encryption, access-control
- Environmental: zero-g-control, habitat-manager

## Current Issues

### 1. Documentation Deployment
- ❌ Outdated GitHub Pages workflow using deprecated `gh-deploy`
- ❌ Missing proper Python version specification (using '3.x' which is too broad)
- ❌ No caching for Python dependencies
- ❌ No concurrency control in workflows

### 2. Testing & Quality
- ❓ Test directory exists but no test automation in CI
- ❌ Missing code quality tools (linters, formatters)
- ❌ No test coverage reporting

### 3. Security
- ❌ Dependencies not pinned to specific versions (potential security risk)
- ❌ No dependency vulnerability scanning
- ❌ No secret scanning in workflows

### 4. Development Experience
- ❌ Missing `.editorconfig` for consistent code style
- ❌ Incomplete `.gitignore` (missing common Python/IDE files)
- ❌ No pre-commit hooks for code quality

## Proposed Improvements

1. **Modernize GitHub Pages Workflow**
   - Use `actions/deploy-pages` instead of `gh-deploy`
   - Add proper Python version management
   - Implement caching for faster builds
   - Add concurrency controls

2. **Enhance Testing & Quality**
   - Add pytest with coverage reporting
   - Include linters (ruff, black) and type checking (mypy)
   - Add automated testing in CI

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Pin dependency versions in requirements.txt
   - Add Dependabot for dependency updates
   - Add security scanning (CodeQL, trivy)

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Add `.editorconfig`
   - Enhance `.gitignore`
   - Add pre-commit hooks
   - Document development setup

## Next Steps
1. Implement the proposed changes in small, reviewable PRs
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Set up monitoring for the documentation site
4. Document the development workflow

## Notes
- The repository shows good structure with separation of concerns
- Documentation is well-organized but could benefit from more detailed API references
- Consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md to help new contributors
