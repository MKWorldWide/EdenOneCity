  - Love Creature Haven (creature_engine.py)
  - Coastal Memory Engine (coastal_memory_engine.py)
  - Temptation Stargate (portal_engine.py)
  - Zero-G Connection Dome (environment_engine.py)
- **Documentation Protocol:** Quantum-detailed, cross-referenced, real-time changelog, and session memory tracking.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Define plug-and-play module interface.
  2. Refactor one engine as template.
  3. Scaffold agent communication layer.
