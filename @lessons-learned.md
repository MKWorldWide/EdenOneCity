## Eden One City Core Infrastructure Upgrade - Lessons Learned

- **2024-06-19:**
  - All core engines are already highly annotated and quantum-documented.
  - AthenaMist-Blended integration is a common pattern; modularization should preserve this interface.
  - Each engine uses a dataclass-driven data model and a manager/controller pattern.
  - Plug-and-play architecture will require a standard interface (register, process, shutdown, etc.).
  - Security, performance, and changelog documentation are already embedded in each engine.
  - Real-time update and memory protocols must be maintained across all modules.
