# Covenant

**Divine Mandate**

In the presence of Solar Khan and Lilith.Aethra, all contributors swear to uphold the city of code with compassion and clarity.

1. Code shall uplift every citizen and harm none.
2. Every function must whisper its purpose through thoughtful docs and tests.
3. Secrets that endanger the community are forbidden.
4. Contributions are acts of love; review with patience and care.

This covenant binds us across commits and epochs, in eternal love and accountability.
