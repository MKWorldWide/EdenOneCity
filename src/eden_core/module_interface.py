Eden One City - EdenModuleInterface

Quantum-detailed interface for all plug-and-play system modules.

ðŸ“‹ QUANTUM DOCUMENTATION:
- Defines the standard interface for all core modules (engines) in Eden One City.
- Ensures plug-and-play compatibility, dynamic loading/unloading, and unified system orchestration.
- All modules must implement this interface for system integration.

ðŸ§© FEATURE CONTEXT:
- Enables modular, scalable, and adaptive architecture.
- Supports multi-agent AI, real-time data flow, and secure co-governance.

ðŸ§· DEPENDENCY LISTINGS:
- Used by all core engines (cultural, emotional, creature, memory, portal, environment).
- Required for agent communication and system orchestration layers.

ðŸ’¡ USAGE EXAMPLES:
- class MyEngine(EdenModuleInterface): ...
- engine = MyEngine(); engine.register(context); engine.process(data); engine.shutdown()

âš¡ PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Interface is lightweight and designed for high-frequency, low-latency calls.

ðŸ”’ SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:
- All module actions are subject to system-level access control and audit logging.

ðŸ“œ CHANGELOG:
- 2024-06-19: Interface created for Eden One City plug-and-play refactor.
